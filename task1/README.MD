Welcome to the **ML4SCI Task 1** project, part of the Machine Learning for Science initiative under Google Summer of Code 2025. This task focuses on differentiating two particles, namely photonüî¶ and electron‚ö°Ô∏è based on their heat enery and time taken to hit the detector. The data is souced from directly from CERN CMS.

## Introduction

A simple CNN approach is not powerful enough to deal with gradients really small. So a ResNet approach is used to make a classifier.  

## Features

- **Feature 1**: Built using Tinygrad 
- **Feature 2**: Run using multiple modes based on system requirements
- **Feature 3**: Memory friendly
